If you look beyond the striking appearance of a Red Velvet Cake, you will find
 that it has a very mild chocolate flavor (it contains just 2 tablespoons 
 (15 grams) of unsweetened cocoa powder. Buttermilk gives this cake its 
 wonderfully moist and tender crumb. Buttermilk has a thick creamy texture with 
 a rich tangy and buttery taste. You can make a good substitute for commercial
  buttermilk by adding 1 tablespoon of white distilled vinegar, cider vinegar,
   or lemon juice to 1 cup (240 ml) of milk and letting this mixture sit at room
    temperature about 10 minutes before using.
Once the Red Velvet Cake has been baked and cooled, I like to chill the layers 
in the refrigerator until firm before filling and frosting the cake. This extra 
step makes the spreading of the frosting a much easier task, as a freshly baked 
cake is quite fragile and when you try to spread the frosting there is a 
tendency for the cake to tear. Refrigerating the cake first eliminates this
 problem. 
I love to frost a Red Velvet Cake with a Cream Cheese Frosting. But the Cream 
Cheese Frosting I use is a little different than most. What makes it different 
is that besides cream cheese, it also contains mascarpone cheese and whipped 
cream. This makes the frosting deliciously rich and creamy. Now, Mascarpone 
cheese is an Italian cheese that is thick, buttery-rich, delicately sweet and 
velvety. It is often sold in plastic 8-ounce (227 grams) tubs. You may find it 
in specialty food stores or in the deli section of your local grocery store. If
 you cannot find Mascarpone just substitute with 8 ounces (227 grams) of cream 
 cheese. This frosting recipe is adapted from 'The Waldorf-Astoria Cookbook' by 
 John Doherty.
